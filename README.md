### Overview
The Weather Application displays current weather information by fetching data from an external weather API. This project is built in ReactJS, with an option to containerize dependencies using Docker or Podman for a consistent and isolated development environment.

##### Features
1.Real-time weather data updates
2.Location-based or city-input weather search
3.Responsive design for various screen sizes
4.User-friendly interface

Prerequisites
Docker or Podman: Required for running the application in a containerized environment.

Node.js and npm: Required for local development and managing dependencies.
React: The frontend library for building the user interface.


## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app

### Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory (this file is not included in the repository for security reasons).

Add your environment variables (e.g., API keys for weather data) as required. Here is an example of what the .env file might look like:

[REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REACT_APP_YOUR_SERVICE_ID=service id
REACT_APP_YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID=templete_id
REACT_APP_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY=public_id](url)

Youâ€™ll need to sign up for a free API key to access weather data, e.g., from OpenWeather. The API provides various weather parameters.

### `Install Dependencies`:
`npm install`

#### Build the Docker Image (optional for containerized deployment):
Ensure Docker or Podman is installed and running.
Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:

`docker build -t weather-app .`
